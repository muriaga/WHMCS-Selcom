# SelcomPay Payment Gateway

/**
 * WHMCS SelcomPay Payment Gateway Module
 *
 * Payment Gateway modules allow you to integrate payment solutions with the
 * WHMCS platform.
 *
 * This sample file demonstrates how a payment gateway module for WHMCS should
 * be structured and all supported functionality it can contain.
 *
 * Within the module itself, all functions must be prefixed with the module
 * filename, followed by an underscore, and then the function name. For this
 * example file, the filename is "gatewaymodule" and therefore all functions
 * begin "gatewaymodule_".
 *
 * If your module or third party API does not support a given function, you
 * should not define that function within your module. Only the _config
 * function is required.
 *
 * For more information, please refer to the online documentation.
 *
